					Choleras common symptoms: water diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, dehydration.
					<p>
					Sever Symptoms :Low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, persistent vomiting and muscle cramps.
					The reason why cholera was such a deadly disease was because the sever diarrhea that cholera caused meant that the person would loose many liters of fluids an untreated person would produce 10 to 20 liters of diarrhea per day.
					Sever diarrhea kills about half of affected individuals and if its not treated it can result in life threatening dehydration
