					<h2> 
					<p>
					Poor water quality is responsible for cholera, it use to be thought that miasma was the cause of cholera (that cholera was transmitted by air)
					Interestingly enough all the data points that cholera is transmitted through water but the first person to prove this was john snow where he made a map to show the outbakes of cholera drawing black lines to represent deaths in broad street(London).
					In his map it showed that the deaths were all close to the broad street pump a source of water for many and interestingly enough there were cases when a people who lived far a way from the pump still died of cholera one of the examples was a 59 year old woman who liked the taste of the water from the broad street pump so she got her son to bring her the water and drank it in the evening and then died of cholera the next day.
					Because of this map attention to the drainage system was important and the water quality was improved.
