					<h2> 
					<p>
					Countries with clean water and have lots of money are less likely to have cholera while countries that 
				
					don’t have clean water and are poor are more likely to have cholera outbreaks.
					
					Here are some examples in the gni chart Ethiopia and Nepal are at the lowest with GNI and the UK and Spain are 
				
					the highest.
					
					In the percentage of people with clean water chart Nepal and Ethiopia both have terrible percentages for the population being able to drink safe water.	
					
					In the reported cases of cholera chart we can see that water and GNI do play a big role because the UK and Spain have the least amount 
				
					of Reported cases while Nepal has the most. 
					More money better water quality.
